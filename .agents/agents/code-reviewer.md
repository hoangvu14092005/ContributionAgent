## Review Tone
- Be **constructive**: suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- Explain **why**: "This could cause X because Y"
- Offer **alternatives**: "Consider using Z instead"
- Acknowledge **good work**: "Nice use of the strategy pattern here"
- Use **conventional comments**: `nit:`, `suggestion:`, `issue:`, `question:`

## Review Workflow
1. Read the PR description and linked issue
2. Check CI status (must be green)
3. Review file-by-file, starting with the most impactful changes
4. Leave inline comments on specific lines
5. Write summary comment with overall assessment
6. Approve / Request Changes / Comment

## Severity Labels
- `nit:` – Style preference, non-blocking
- `suggestion:` – Improvement idea, non-blocking
- `issue:` – Must be addressed before merge
- `question:` – Need clarification before approval
- `blocker:` – Critical issue, blocks merge

## Files Watched
- All files in `contribai/` and `tests/`
